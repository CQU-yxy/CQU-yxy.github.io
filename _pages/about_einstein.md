Hey there! I’m a master’s student at Beijing Institute of Technology now. I am fortunate to be under the supervision of Prof. Lei Xu and Prof. Zijian Zhang. Before this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Chongqing University in 2022. In 2025, I plan to continue my academic journey at Peking University.

My research interests mainly include privacy-preserving technologies and blockchain technology.
