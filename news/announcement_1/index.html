I’m also excited to share that I have published two JCR-Q1 papers last month, in Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) and IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (TNSM). Additionally, I’m thrilled to announce that I have been admitted to Peking University’s PhD program in Software Engineering. <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p> </body></html>
